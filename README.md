# MERN-SampleProject

A sample project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack with TypeScript integration for both frontend and backend development.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application implementation using the MERN stack with TypeScript as the primary programming language. The project includes both frontend and backend components.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React with TypeScript
  - HTML5 & CSS3
  - Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js with TypeScript
  - MongoDB

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:
- `frontend/`: Contains the React TypeScript application
- `backend/`: Contains the Express.js TypeScript server

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaveenDK/MERN-SampleProject.git
cd MERN-SampleProject
```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your MongoDB connection string and other environment variables.

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application should now be running with:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

## Features

- TypeScript integration for better type safety and developer experience
- Full-stack MERN implementation
- Modern JavaScript features
- Scalable project structure
- API integration between frontend and backend
